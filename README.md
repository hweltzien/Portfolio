# Portfolio

## Description
After utilizing web-based resources and instructional support, this professional porfolio serves several important purposes. It introduces myself as a potential employee and provides examples of my work and completed projects. It can facilitate networking and will be continuously updated and refined to reflect my professional development.

I learned how to start a web application from scratch by applying classroom knowledge and skills. I read technical documentation to debug and find solutions for desired outcomes.
